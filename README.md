# Music Collection Cataloger

This site is meant to be used as a cataloging tools for collectors of Vinyl, CDs, and Cassette tapes.  Collectors can add their collections to the website to keep track of an extensive collection or just show off some cool items they've come across. Think Discogs meets social media. 

# Project Plan

In this Project Jacob and I will be building a Full CRUD express application. When buildling out our application we will divide respobsiblities as follows.  Directories and files Justin: Config/db.connections, Controllers, Server.js, and Models/.  Directories and files Jacob: /views including ejs files and partials/ public/styles main.css.  Jacob will take the lead on styling methods based on wireframes with Justin consulting along the way. Justin will setup the github, and mongoDB with sharing permissions.

# User Story

Our website is going to be a resource for music media collectors to catalog their collections, provide write ups, estimate collection values, and view the collections of others.  Users will be able to create, read, update, and delete items from their collections. They will also be able to comment on individual collections of others.
